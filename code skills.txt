Sharkboy was not always

half shark, half boy.

He was a marine biologist -

or, at least, in training.

His father studied

great white sharks

and called his son "Sharkboy" because of

how much he loved to care for the sharks.

He made them sushi

and had given them all names:

Goodmilk, Peggy, Eggbat...

and Crackett.

But one day an incredible,

mysterious storm appeared.

It swept away the entire laboratory.

Sharkboy!

Thanks to their life rafts,

Sharkboy and his father survived.

But they survived

on different sides of the wreckage,

each floating off in a

different direction.

Sharkboy!

Sharkboy was completely alone.

Almost completely.

But one of the sharks

recognized him.

Hey, it's Sharkboy.

Don't take a bite outta him, boys -

he's a friend.

They took Sharkboy to their cave home

, where he'd be safe and dry.

His new family were sharks.

Hundreds of sharks.

The sharks raised him

as one of their own,

training him in the

ways of the shark.

You must keep moving to survive.

Always go forward, never back.

To live by instinct

and instinct alone.

Eventually he grew gills,

and sharp talons for claws.

His teeth sharpened themselves

to a point.

He grew fins - all sorts of fins.

But that was years ago.

I first met Sharkboy while

fishing on the dock this summer.

He seemed lost.

- You have to get a job!

- No, I have a job!

So I snuck him home...

Then maybe you should just leave.

when my parents

were too busy to notice.

I kept him fed and in water.

He had been traveling the universe

in search of his father.

He told me of his latest adventures

on a planet so cool it makes you drool.

He said I too

could go to Planet Drool someday.

Then one night

I was visited by a glowing light.

An amazing girl with purple flames for hair

and skin of molten lava rock appeared.

I called her...

Lavagirl.

She smiled at me,

for that seemed to be her name.

She told me she needed Sharkboy

to return to Planet Drool with her,

for a great crisis was developing.

She asked if I could go with them.

I told her, "I have school tomorrow. "

She gave me a sad look

and flamed away,

taking Sharkboy with her.

I haven't seen Sharkboy

or Lavagirl since then.

And that's what I did this summer.

Enough!

Someone is picking that up.

And it's not gonna be me!

We were supposed to tell true stories.

That is a true story.

- Does Lavagirl have special powers?

- There's no such thing as Lavagirl.

She can...

She can shoot lava out of her hands.

Cool.

How many people think

Max's story is true?

- Not true.

- Made up.

- Not true.

- It's just a made-up story.

If it's true, why don't you bring

Sharkboy and Lavagirl to class tomorrow?

They went away.

I don't know where they went.

Have a seat, Max.

Linus, you're next.

This summer, I met a new friend...

who was half dork, half boy.

I called him Dorkboy.

But his real name was Max.

We had him for dinner, but he stunk

so bad that we all blew chunks.

That's enough, Linus.

Linus, Max, stay.

Come on, Mr. E!

Class, what's my name?

Mr. Electricidad.

Mr. Electricidad, exactly.

Not Mr. Electric,

not Mr. Electrici-tha-tha-tha-tha.

Linus, you just earned a minus

for your behavior today.

This is a new year.

Do you think you can be friends?

No.

Then it's been decided:

You'll be the best of friends.

Which means

no more picking on Max, Linus.

Max.

You're in the fourth grade.

There are some good kids in this class.

Find them. Make friends with them.

Dreaming keeps you from seeing

what's right here in front of you.

This isn't a dream.

This is the real world.
Lost my train of thought.

No dreaming. Got it.

I'll try harder.

What do you have there?

It's my dream journal.

It has all of my most

precious dreams in it.

I'll never part with it

for as long as I live.

You're a good kid, Max.

Max!

Let's be imaginary friends.

You can try and hang with us...

and we'll pretend you don't exist!

Check it out.

Sharkboy gets shocked by electric eels,

and then they feed on his cooked flesh.

Wow, Linus.

Your skills are... weak.

Ohh...

I'm gonna burst your bubble, Dream Boy.

You're dead!

Get the book!

Give me the book.

Hand over the book,

or you'll visit the dream world!

Ooh...

Agh-haa...

All right! Got it!

I'll bring you a revised edition tomorrow.

- Max, wake up!

- Dream, Max.

- Open your eyes, Max. - Eyes

open, and dream. Stay dreaming.

Wake up!

Sharkboy!

And Lavagirl!

Hyah!

Max!

My cookies! My giant cookies!

What are you doing baking sweets? You

know what happens when he eats sugar.

I baked them for his class.

So you could make friends at school,

and now you've eaten all of them.

No, it was Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

Look - this one has shark bites,

and this one is singed.

There's no such thing

as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

Well, I believe him.

Your mother's right. When you go to sleep

and close your eyes, they may come back.

But when you open 'em again, Sharkgirl

and Lavaboy'll be... outta here.

- But...

- Shh. Mouth closed, eyes closed.

- Now?

- Yes, now.

You can wait till you're in bed

to close your eyes, Max.

Kids need their dreams.

Kids... need to grow up!

He's not making any friends

with these cookies!

There's no such thing

as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

There's no such thing

as Sharkboy and Lavagirl.

Yes, there is.

Stupid plugs!

Please don't let me have to go to school.

They'll make fun of me, I know it!

I wish I could just escape this loser world

and go to Planet Drool.

Games and toys and laughs and fun...

May there be terrible storms,

rain, sleet, snow, tornadoes...

so I can lay here all day tomorrow

and dream of Drool.

Guess I didn't dream hard enough.

There are plenty of good opportunities.

You just need to look.

Ooh, traffic engineer!

Hey.

I was cleaning out my closet

and look what I found.

Remember Tobor?

The robot you tried to build?

Why were you cleaning out your closet?

I had to find one of these.

- Is Mom making you get a real job again?

- Writing is a real job.

- When it pays.

- Max, I'm walking you to school today.

So what do you say?

Wanna finish making Tobor?

It won't work.

- Well, how do you know?

- 'Cause you told me it wouldn't.

I did?

I'm sorry.

I should've never said that.

It's OK. You were right.

Dumb idea.

How did these happen?

The grass was dead anyway.

Why are you so morbid?

I just wish anything could happen

so I wouldn't have to go to school today.

That's not realistic, Max.

It's bad enough your father's head

is in the clouds, but not you too, OK?

Just push that dream aside and move on.

Like with your dream?

The one about you and Dad and me?

Well, I do have a dream about us,

but, as I'm sure you've been noticing

lately, your father and I are just...

Well, we're... not compatible.

Sorry. I don't mean to dump all this on you

right before you have to go to school, but...

school's waiting.

Did we have to move so close to school?

Your father thought

we'd save money on gas.

Come right home after school today, 'cause

there's some things we need to talk about.

I love you.

I wish anything could happen

so I wouldn't have to come home today.

Hey, look, it's Dream Boy!

Who knows where tornadoes come from?

Well, when cold air mixes with hot air,

it can form a tornado,

as the hot and cold chase each other

around and around and around.

I dreamt of a story kind of like Sharkboy

and Lavagirl - Ice Girl and Dream Boy.

Her powers come from her crystal heart.

No more fairy tales.

Piranha Girl and Beluga Boy.

Plastic Boy and Metal Girl.

Barf Boy and Vomit Girl.

Does everyone hear me?

I'm a teacher, right?

Wrong. I'm an awakener.

Only I'm finding it more and more difficult

to keep my class... awake.

No recess again for you, Marissa -

too many allergies.

There are more boogers on your work

than there is work.

I'm just cold.

I'll be happy to change places with you.

It's a lot warmer back there in my spot.

But I... have to sit up front.

It's just that you're sitting

right under the vent.

- It's August and you're sneezing.

- You're gonna get me in trouble.

Max.

Are you... trying to make real friends?

Trying, like you told me to.

That's good.

Just not with my daughter, OK?

No! It wasn't like that. It's just...

Sit down, Max.

- Give me back my journal!

- Class has begun. Everyone in your seats.

- Linus took my journal!

- I did not!

Minus! I mean, Linus.

You get a minus for misconduct.

Give Max back his journal.

One more time, Linus, and we'll have to

change your name to Minus.

He ruined my dream journal!

I did not! Mr. Electric,

send him to the principal's office

and have him expelled!

You're in my class,

not the other way around!

I know everything

and you know nothing!

At the end of class, both of you

report to the principal's office!

With your parents!

Everybody down!

It's them!

I'm looking for Max.

She's hot!

Whoa!

We need your help, Max.

Come with us.

What do I have to do?

Go with us to Planet Drool

We'll explain on the way.

We're going to Planet Drool?

It's my home planet.

Just outside our solar system.

You should know, Max - you made it up.

- I can't go with you.

- Why not?

Because you're not real.

Both of you are just a dream.

And when I open my eyes, you'll be gone.

We're still here, Max.

If you wanna stop the darkness

from destroying our worlds, come with us.

You better go with them.

OK... I'll go.

Everyone follow me

and we'll find shelter.

I can't believe I'm finally getting

to ditch this place and go to Planet Drool!

How are we getting there?

Put these on, everybody.

Blue goggles for the boys,

pink for the girls.

Do you have another pair of boy goggles?

Uh-uh.

So, how do you fly it?

- You don't know?

- Duh!

That's sort of been the whole problem!

You press go.

- Now, how do you fly it?

- It's got an autopilot.

You just thought of everything,

didn't you, Max?

Not exactly.

- How do we land it?

- That's the part I never thought of!

Jupiter... Saturn... Neptune...

You might wanna hold on to something.

Recognize your dream world, Max?

Not really.

I feel like I should,

but I just don't.

It's affecting him too.

I thought he would just remember.

- Remember what?

- Your dreams. This planet?

Us.

Your powers.

- I have powers?

- More than any of us.

Don't you know that?

Everything that is or was,

began with a dream.

And you dreamt us, Max.

Us and this whole place.

I did?

Every dream you ever had

landed right here on Planet Drool.

Why is it so dark?

The planet is dying.

It began yesterday.

What's the calculation, Sharkboy?

45 minutes till the darkness

destroys Planet Drool.

We didn't go to Earth to save you, Max.

We need you to save Planet Drool.

But how?

The Dream Lair

is on the other side of the planet.
